The Decatur Supper Club (DSC) is a potluck-style gathering of friends, new and old, sharing meals and building community in and around Decatur, GA. Started by Forrest Brown in December 2025, the DSC hosts monthly dinner parties at our members' homes. Each dinner party has a theme, and everyone brings a dish to share.

Check our [calendar](/#calendar) to see when the next dinner party is, and [sign up](/#sign-up) if you want to get in on the fun. Let's eat some good food and build community!
